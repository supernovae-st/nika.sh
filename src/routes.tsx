/* ─── central route table · React Router v7 data router ──────────────────────
   Replaces the old hand-rolled hash navigation (#/blog, #/manifesto …) with
   real paths. In-page anchors (#language, #verbs, #install …) stay native
   scroll anchors INSIDE Home, not routes.

   Pages are referenced SYNCHRONOUSLY via `Component` (not RR `lazy`): the
   build-time prerenderer (vite-plugin-react-ssg, route mode) renders each route
   through React Router's static handler, which does NOT await `lazy` dynamic
   imports — a `lazy` route resolves after Vite's SSR module runner has closed
   and the route renders the default ErrorBoundary instead. Sync `Component`
   keeps the route table the single source of truth for both prerender and the
   browser router. Genuinely heavy leaves stay code-split where they're used
   (e.g. the three.js galaxy via React.lazy in ClientOnlyGalaxy). */
